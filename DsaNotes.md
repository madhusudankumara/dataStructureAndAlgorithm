### **Wildcard Pattern Matching problem**
   - What Algorithm is Used? 
     - The code uses Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve the Wildcard Pattern Matching problem.

   - Why Dynamic Programming? 
     - Because we break the problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and store their results in a 2D table 
     (memoization), avoiding redundant calculations.
